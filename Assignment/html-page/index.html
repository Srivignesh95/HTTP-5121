            <h2>Travelling & Me</h2>

            <p>I am Srivignesh Kavle and this is my blog "The Journey". I have made this blog to record the evolution of my hobby, which is travelling.</p>

            <div class="content-flex">

            <p>I have always been fond of travelling, right from my childhood. When I was little, I only travelled for our family tours, which were always fun and lively with my whole family and cousins. Maybe that's what inspired me to travel, the smell of a new place, the taste of freedom and the wonders of meeting new people. Slowly, I started to have a stable career, which gave me the financial freedom to expand my horizons. Intracity trips became intercity and interstate trips. I found my tribe and started travelling with them. I made new friends, met new people, learnt new languages and felt new experiences. Through travelling, I also developed a love for driving bikes and cars. I became the designated driver for most trips, a role I enjoyed a bit too much.</p>

            <p>I have seen the best of humanity while travelling; I was in the middle of a trip when COVID-19 hit, which is a story for another day!</p>

                <img src="image/canada.jpg" alt="Canada" title="Canada"> 
                <p>I haven't had the chance to explore much of Canada due to Academic and work responsibilities and the lack of stability, but I'm hopeful that I'll be able to do that pretty soon. I can't wait to make new memories in Canada and learn new things.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In my opinion, everyone must travel. It's not just a break from a routine and monotonous routine that rejuvenates you, it's also a way to connect with the world and people around you in the most organic way.</p>

            <p><strong>Let's keep travelling..........</strong></p>
